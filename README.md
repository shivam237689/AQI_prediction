# AQI_prediction
AQI India(2015-2020)

TASK: 
      1. Feature Engineering and calculate the AQI based of the given details in the dataset. As it is not given on the Dataset.
      2. EDA Using Visualisation and Data Analysis tools. 
      3. Use Data Processing tools to clean and filter Data by using Time-Series Analysis to Predict the rate and rise in the pollution.

In this project, Here, i had 2 data set namely 'city day' and 'station day' where there was 10 pollutants as an independent variables and AQI as a dependent variables with Date, AQI_Bucket and so on. I have calculated AQI by analysing the data of previous years and using some statistical measurements, and calculations. EDA done very neatly with wide range of visualizations using diffrent tools. After calcualting AQI, Time series to be used for the prediction of rate and rise in polllution(AQI) this gave me almost 92% accuracy.
